# Airport-Seat-Allocation-System
This is a system developed in Java programming language. The project involves implementation of data structures such as the TreeMap and Hashing. The system helps the customer who has already booked his ticket to know his seat number. It is believed that while booking ticket, the customer selects as to which class he wants to travel with. The flight consists of the Economy class and the VIP class and is alloted an customerID upon booking his ticket. The TreeMap acts like a database which helps in providing unique seat number to the customer with the help of hashing after proper verification.
